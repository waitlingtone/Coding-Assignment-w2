<h1>This is title</h1>
<div class="row">
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-5">
    	<p class="rightTop">Section</p>
        <p class="normal"> Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles from the mockup illustration (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.)
 </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-5">
    	<p class="rightTop">Spacing</p>
        <p class="normal">Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing between sections (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges of the browser window. Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make sure the dummy text is “pushed down” enough so it doesn’t overlap the section title region. (Hint: use margins and padding and use border-box as your box-sizing as discussed in Lecture 19.)
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-10">
    	<p class="rightTop">OPTIONAL</p>	
        <p class="normal">You will NOT be graded on this, but you may want to explicitly set a font-family for the text in your page, so you are not stuck with the default browser font family. Also, set the font size of the heading and section title to be 75% larger and 25% larger (respectively) than the font size of the dummy text.</p>
